# **About Me**

Hi there! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
a multidisciplinary Mechanical Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems across robotics, biomechanics, computer graphics, and software systems. With a strong foundation in dynamics, machine design, numerical methods, and algorithms, I specialize in creating innovative and efficient solutions that bridge hardware and software.

I’m proficient in a wide range of programming languages, including Python, C/C++, C#, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, GLSL, and HLSL. My experience spans biomedical systems, computer graphics and graphics programming, rapid prototyping, and adaptive biomechanical design to support paraplegics. I also bring hands-on expertise in VFX, video editing, image editing, web development, and creative media production.

This multidisciplinary background enables me to think across domains, collaborate effectively with diverse teams, and approach technical challenges from unique, hybrid perspectives. It’s helped me become not just a problem solver—but a systems thinker who connects the dots between engineering, design, and storytelling.

I hold professional certifications in Git and Linux and am currently seeking internship opportunities in robotics, biomedical engineering, software development, computer graphics, and related fields. If you're working on a project that could benefit from an adaptable, creative, and technically grounded engineer, please reach out!
