# **About Me**

Hi there! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
a strong mechanical engineer able to optimize complex projects and find creative solutions using code.

I have professional certifications in source control systems (such as Git) and Linux. I am in a Biomedical Systems track, and I'm experienced in many programming languages (including Python, C/C++, C#, and more) with a strong base in Dynamics, Biomechanics, Machine Design, Vibrations, Numerical Methods, and Algorithms.

I have a special interest in humanoid robotics and prosthetics, and I'm currently seeking internships in robotics, biomedical engineering, and software systems.

If you have a project that aligns with my skills and interests, I'd love to connect and discuss how I can contribute!
